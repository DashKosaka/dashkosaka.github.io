				<h1 class="major">AlphaSmash: Building a Bot for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Using Deep Learning</h1>

				<p>
					In February 2019, AlphaSmash was developed as part of the HackIllinois 2019 hackathon. Inspired by
					the AI systems <strong>AlphaGo</strong> and <strong>AlphaStar</strong>, we set out to create a bot
					that could challenge and potentially beat friends in <strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong> on
					the Nintendo Switch. The project combined <strong>deep Q-learning</strong> and <strong>computer
						vision</strong> to train a reinforcement learning agent capable of playing the game
					autonomously.

				<h3>Key Contributions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Developed a bot using Deep Q-learning and computer vision to continuously learn and
							improve in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Designed a custom setup using Arduino, relays, a webcam, and controllers to interact
							with the Nintendo Switch in real time.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Integrated OCR to interpret in-game health percentages, allowing the bot to evaluate its
							performance and adjust its strategies.</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Key Project: AlphaSmash - Learning to Play Super Smash Bros.</h3>
				<p>The goal of AlphaSmash was simple yet ambitious: train an AI to play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
					autonomously and effectively. The inspiration came from advanced AI systems like
					<strong>AlphaGo</strong> and <strong>AlphaStar</strong>, and we applied similar principles using a
					mix of hardware and machine learning techniques.
				</p>

				<h4>Setup</h4>
				<p>The system consisted of a compute machine, <strong>Arduino Zero</strong>, Nintendo Switch, webcam,
					controllers, and <strong>mechanical relays</strong>. To reduce costs and latency, we avoided using a
					capture card and instead relied on a webcam to record the game screen. The webcam feed was then
					processed by a <strong>CNN + DQN (Deep Q-Network)</strong> model, which identified the current game
					state.</p>

				<h4>Action Generation & Control</h4>
				<p>The <strong>CNN</strong> processed visual inputs, while the <strong>DQN</strong> generated an action
					vector based on the game state. These actions, which corresponded to controller inputs, were
					physically sent to the Switch using mechanical relays controlled by the Arduino. This bypassed the
					need to directly hack into the Switch, while still allowing our system to interact with the game.
				</p>

				<h4>Feedback Loop</h4>
				<p>In-game health percentages, captured through <strong>OCR</strong>, provided the reinforcement agent
					with feedback on performance, allowing it to update its Q-values and improve over time.
					<strong>Transfer learning</strong> was also used to speed up the training process by applying a
					pre-trained CNN model to interpret visual data more efficiently. The ultimate goal was to train the
					AI solely against in-game bots, creating an automated training loop for continuous improvement.
				</p>

				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>Though the system worked, several challenges arose, particularly balancing hardware and software
					interactions. The use of mechanical relays to control the Switch introduced some response time
					limitations, while using a webcam instead of direct video input added noise to the visual data.
					Additionally, the short timeframe of the hackathon meant we couldn’t fully train the AI model, but
					early results showed promise, as the bot exhibited basic patterns like moving, attacking, and
					responding to in-game events.</p>

				<p>Despite the bot occasionally getting stuck in repetitive loops (such as moving to the left platform,
					attacking, then moving to the right and falling off), these patterns were proof that the system was
					learning and reacting to the game environment, albeit in an incomplete form.</p>

				<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Python, Pytorch</li>
					<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: CNNs, Deep Q-Learning, Transfer Learning</li>
					<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: OpenCV, OCR</li>
					<li><strong>Hardware</strong>: Arduino Zero, Mechanical Relays, Nintendo Switch</li>
					<li><strong>Other</strong>: GitHub, Reinforcement Learning</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While we didn’t reach a fully trained AI in the time available, <strong>AlphaSmash</strong> was an
					exciting project that explored the potential of combining hardware and AI for gaming. You can view
					the progress and code on the <a href="https://github.com/DashKosaka/AlphaSmash"
