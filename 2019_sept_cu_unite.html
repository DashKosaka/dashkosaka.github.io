				<h1 class="major">CU Unite: Connecting the Champaign-Urbana Community</h1>
				<p>In September 2019, <strong>CU Unite</strong> was developed during the Pyghack 2019 hackathon to
					create a platform that helps visualize and analyze student organizations and their impact on campus.
					By offering an interactive dashboard, CU Unite enables both students and faculty to gain insights
					into how well organizations are contributing to the community and fostering involvement.</p>

				<h2>What is CU Unite?</h2>
				<p><strong>CU Unite</strong> is a community-focused platform designed to bring together students,
					faculty, and others in the Champaign-Urbana (CU) area. It empowers users to start initiatives, gain
					visibility, and receive the support they need to make a difference. The interactive dashboard allows
					organization monitors to track the success and involvement of various student organizations,
					ensuring that they are actively contributing to the CU community.</p>

				<h2>Future Plans</h2>
				<p>We plan to expand the CU Unite platform, offering it to local volunteer organizations as a way to
					gain momentum and visibility. By next fall, we aim to launch CU Unite across the Champaign-Urbana
					community. If the test case is successful, we envision scaling the platform to more urban areas
					where it could have an even greater impact.</p>
