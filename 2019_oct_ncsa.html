				<h1 class="major">Remote Sensing & Machine Learning in Agricultural Analytics</h1>
				<p><strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</strong><br>
					<strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</strong><br>
				</p>
				<p>During my October 2019 internship with NCSA as part of UIUCâ€™s Students Pushing Innovation (SPIN)
					program in, I worked as an academic research intern. I focused on remote sensing and machine
					learning in the agricultural sector. The research centered on utilizing satellite imagery to monitor
					agricultural health in the Midwest, with an emphasis on waterlogging detection and geometric
					correction of satellite imagery. The key goal was to provide scalable, precise data that could aid
					farmers and analysts in evaluating crop performance and making data-driven decisions.</p>

				<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Waterlogging Detection</strong>: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
						detect waterlogged areas in agricultural land, achieving 95% accuracy.</li>
					<li><strong>Geometric Correction</strong>: Corrected errors in satellite image calibration with
						computer vision techniques, improving image accuracy to sub-meter levels.</li>
					<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Worked extensively with Python, Pytorch, OpenCV, and GIS tools
						to process large-scale hyperspectral satellite imagery data.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Key Project: Waterlogging Detection in Champaign County</h2>
				<p>One of my core contributions involved building a deep learning model to detect waterlogged
					farmland in Champaign County using hyperspectral imagery from the PlanetLab CubeSat. The
					agricultural sector faces significant challenges when it comes to waterlogging, which negatively
					impacts crop yields. This project focused on identifying waterlogged areas to assess their
					effect on agricultural productivity.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Worked with ~250 CubeSat images, approximately 40GB of 3m
						resolution imagery, manually labeling the waterlogged areas.</li>
					<li><strong>Model</strong>: Developed a U-Net architecture in Pytorch that achieved 95% accuracy
						in segmenting waterlogged farmland.</li>
					<li><strong>Scaling</strong>: Scaled the solution to cover hundreds of counties across Illinois,
						analyzing hundreds of gigabytes of GIS data.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Key Project: Geometric Correction on High-Resolution Satellite Imagery</h2>
				<p>In a second project, I tackled the challenge of geometric correction for high-resolution
					satellite images. These images, crucial for precision agriculture, often suffer from locational
					drift and distortion due to imperfect extrinsic calibration. The goal was to correct this drift
					through advanced computer vision and geospatial techniques.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: The system lacked reliable locational accuracy due to
						calibration drift, causing distortions in GIS-based agricultural data.</li>
					<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Applied a combination of SIFT and RANSAC computer vision
						algorithms for feature matching, followed by geospatial transformations to achieve sub-meter
						accuracy.</li>
					<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Improved the reliability and accuracy of satellite imagery for
						precision farming applications requiring exact geographic information.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>One of the most difficult aspects of the internship was dealing with the sheer scale of the data,
					which often required complex optimizations in both computation and memory handling. The
					combination of remote sensing techniques and machine learning, though effective, had its hurdles
					due to noise and variability in satellite data. Additionally, working with multi-channel TIF
					files for hyperspectral analysis added another layer of complexity in terms of data
					preprocessing and interpretation.</p>

				<hr>

				<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Python, Pytorch, OpenCV</li>
					<li><strong>Remote Sensing Tools</strong>: GIS, Sentinel-2, CubeSat</li>
					<li><strong>Techniques</strong>: Machine Learning, CNNs, SIFT, RANSAC, Geometric Transformations
					</li>
					<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Cloud Computing, GNSS, Git</li>
				</ul>


				<p>This experience laid the foundation for further exploration into the application of remote sensing
					and AI in agriculture. Both the waterlogging detection and geometric correction projects showcased
					the potential of modern ML/AI techniques in resolving real-world agricultural challenges.</p>
