				<h1 class="major">Embedded Systems & Front-End Development at Cohesive Manufacturing</h1>

				<div class="section">
					<p>In September 2019, I took on a short-term position as a software engineering contractor at
						Cohesive Manufacturing, a startup focused on providing monitoring solutions for critical
						infrastructure in the manufacturing industry. My role spanned both embedded systems and
						front-end development, allowing me to work on cutting-edge projects that improved the
						reliability of critical equipment monitoring while enhancing user experience through web
						applications.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>

				<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud-Monitoring Engine</strong>: Developed the core embedded systems for a
						cloud-based engine to monitor and control mission-critical equipment in manufacturing
						environments.</li>
					<li><strong>Sensor Driver Development</strong>: Designed C++ software drivers for acquiring and
						interpreting ADC data from three different sensors, ensuring precise monitoring and data
						reliability.</li>
					<li><strong>Real-Time Data Logging</strong>: Managed an Arduino-based embedded system to log
						structural data in real-time, achieving less than 20 ms latency for seamless cloud
						integration.</li>
					<li><strong>Front-End Enhancements</strong>: Improved the front-end interfaces of customer
						websites by adding multi-language support, which boosted user engagement and usability
						across different regions.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Key Project: Cloud-Monitoring Engine for Critical Equipment</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>A major aspect of my work at Cohesive Manufacturing was centered around developing a
						cloud-monitoring engine. This engine was designed to log, control, and react to
						irregularities in critical equipment across small and medium manufacturing facilities. By
						building and optimizing sensor drivers, I ensured that the system could acquire and
						interpret data from three mission-critical sensors, providing continuous monitoring to
						prevent operational losses.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong>: I developed C++ drivers for sensors that measured
							various equipment parameters and processed ADC data, ensuring high precision in
							detecting changes in equipment status.</li>
						<li><strong>Real-Time Logging</strong>: With the integration of an Arduino system, I set up
							a real-time data pipeline to stream sensor data to the cloud with less than 20 ms
							latency, enabling prompt alerts and actions when irregularities were detected.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>Key Project: Manufacturing Transactions Engine</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>In addition to the monitoring system, I also contributed to the development of a
						manufacturing transactions engine, which powers web applications designed for end-customers
						and supply chain engineers. This engine was created to streamline the execution of
						manufacturing transactions in complex supply chain arrangements, including large OEMs and
						job shops across the country.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: The application features a modern 3D browser
							visualization tool, allowing users to interact with and manage manufacturing jobs
							easily.</li>
						<li><strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: I enhanced the user experience by enabling
							multi-language support across customer-facing web applications, which broadened the
							usability of the application for diverse customers.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Working on both the embedded and front-end aspects of the project required balancing
						real-time data processing with user-friendly web interfaces. Ensuring that sensor data was
						both accurate and delivered promptly to the cloud while simultaneously optimizing front-end
						performance for global users posed a unique challenge. The combination of these technologies
						required careful resource management, both in terms of computational efficiency on the
						embedded side and ease of use for the end customers.</p>
				</div>

				<hr>

				<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Arduino, C++, Microcontrollers</li>
					<li><strong>Front-End Development</strong>: HTML, Javascript, Multi-Language Support</li>
					<li><strong>Networking</strong>: Cloud Integration, Data Logging</li>
					<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Ubuntu, Web Applications</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This experience showcased the challenges and rewards of working on mission-critical systems that
					require both technical precision and user-focused design. My time at Cohesive Manufacturing
					strengthened my expertise in embedded systems and front-end development, providing valuable
					insights into real-time data management and the critical role of responsive interfaces in
					industrial applications.</p>
